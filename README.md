# Credit-Card-Customer-churn-prediction
Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for credit card users using a neural network. The model leverages Keras to build a feedforward neural network with dense layers. Key components include:

Libraries Used:Numpy, Pandas, Matpplotlib, sklearn, Keras (for building and training the neural network)
Layers: Dense layers to construct the network
Activation Functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, and Sigmoid for the output layer to produce probabilities for churn classification
The objective of the project is to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them. The model was trained on a dataset of credit card transactions, and the performance is evaluated based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
